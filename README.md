# Development of Security Policies and Implementation of Controls

## Introduction
This project involves the development of security policies and the implementation of corresponding controls within a simulated organizational environment. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of IT systems, as well as to mitigate potential security threats.

## Objectives
- Develop comprehensive security policies.
- Implement security controls to enforce these policies.
- Ensure alignment with industry standards and best practices.

## Tools and Software
- VMware Workstation
- Kali Linux
- Security Onion
- pfSense
- Metasploit
- OpenVAS
- Windows Server

## Lab Environment Setup

### Step 1: Ensure the Lab Environment is Running
- **VMware Workstation**: Verify that all VMs (Kali Linux, Windows Server, Security Onion, pfSense) are powered on and networked correctly.

### Step 2: Install and Configure Security Tools
1. **Kali Linux**: Ensure tools like Metasploit, OpenVAS, and Wireshark are installed and updated.
2. **Security Onion**: Ensure Security Onion is configured for network monitoring and analysis.
3. **pfSense**: Ensure pfSense is configured for firewall and VPN management.

## Step 3: Develop Security Policies

### Policy 1: Access Control Policy
1. **Objective**: Ensure that only authorized users have access to IT systems and data.
2. **Components**:
   - **User Authentication**: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) using tools like Okta or OAuth.
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Define roles and assign permissions based on job responsibilities.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Configure MFA for all users in the lab environment.
   - Use Windows Server Active Directory to define roles and permissions.

### Policy 2: Data Protection Policy
1. **Objective**: Protect sensitive data from unauthorized access and breaches.
2. **Components**:
   - **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using protocols like AES-256 and TLS.
   - **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity levels and apply appropriate protection measures.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Use OpenVPN for secure data transmission.
   - Encrypt sensitive files on Windows Server and Ubuntu VMs.

### Policy 3: Incident Response Policy
1. **Objective**: Establish a structured approach to handle security incidents.
2. **Components**:
   - **Incident Detection**: Use tools like Security Onion and OpenVAS for continuous monitoring and vulnerability assessment.
   - **Incident Handling**: Define procedures for incident reporting, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Configure Security Onion to monitor network traffic and detect anomalies.
   - Develop an incident response plan and document the steps.

## Step 4: Implement Security Controls

### Control 1: Firewall Management
1. **Objective**: Control and monitor incoming and outgoing network traffic.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Configure pfSense to allow only necessary traffic and block unauthorized access.
   - Create rules to allow traffic based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols.

### Control 2: Endpoint Protection
1. **Objective**: Protect endpoints from malware and unauthorized access.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Install and configure antivirus software on all VMs.
   - Use Windows Defender and ClamAV for continuous scanning and real-time protection.

### Control 3: Secure Logging and Monitoring
1. **Objective**: Ensure comprehensive logging and monitoring of security events.
2. **Implementation**:
   - Configure Security Onion to collect and analyze logs from all systems.
   - Use Syslog and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging and visualization.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of developing and implementing security policies and controls in a simulated organizational environment. By following these steps, you will create a secure environment that protects IT systems and data from potential threats. Documenting these policies and controls will showcase your ability to design and enforce security measures effectively.
